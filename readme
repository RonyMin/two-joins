I am using cmake for compiling the requested binaries.
You can find already compiled binaries in /bin, or you can build them yourself.
When running the binaries, please make sure you have enough memory space (some test cases require main+swap>=8G).

structure of current dir:
.git/: contains version control informations.
bin/: contains binary files, intermediate files for compiling, also a script and some cases for testing.
include/: contains header files.
src/: contains source files corresponding to header files.

leapfrog.cpp: source file for compiling binary leapfrog.
sortmerge.cpp: source file for compiling binary sortmerge.
CMakeLists.txt: cmake config file.
readme: this file.
